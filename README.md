CallFlow (v2)
============

CallFlow is an interactive visual analysis tool that provides a high-level overview of CCTs together with semantic refinement operations to progressively explore the
CCTs.

# Installation.
Server
```
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install

export PATH={PATH/TO/CALLFLOW}:$PATH
```

Client

```
cd CallFlow/public
npm install
```

# Preparing Data.

Callflow currently, supports two formats, [hpctoolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org/) and [caliper](www.github.com/LLNL/caliper).

```
{$CALLFLOW_PATH}/data/{hpctoolkit_dataset}
	.../experiment.xml
	.../experiment-001.metric-db
	.../experiment-002.metric-db
	.../experiment-003.metric-db
	...

{$CALLFLOW_PATH}/data/{caliper_dataset}
	.../data/experiment.json

```

# Configuration file.
CallFlow requires the user to specify how various data preprocessing operations are performed (i.e., filtering, grouping operations).

To process the datasets,
```
cd CallFlow/server
python3 app.py --config {config_file_path} --runName {config_file_name} --ensemble --process
```

To run the server,

```
cd CallFlow/server
python3 app.py --config {config_file_path} --runName {config_file_name} --ensemble  
```


To run the app,

```
cd CallFlow/public
npm run dev
```
